Description: Breeding programs can be simulated with this package. The functions are written to simulate production and reproduction systems encountered in aquaculture and are easy to combine with custom functions. Simulating breeding programs is useful to predict the expected genetic gain, rate of inbreeding and the effect of changes in the breeding program. AquaBPsim does not simulate genome wide-markers and QTLs, but it simulates estimated breeding values as values correlated to the true breeding values. The correlation equals the accuracy, which can be provided or calculated using deterministic formulas. For genomic selection, the accuracy can be calculate using the formula of Deatwyler et al. (2010) <doi:10.1534/genetics.110.116855>. Without genomic selection, accuracy can be calculated with the selection index method (Mrode, 2014. ISBN:978-1-84593-981-6).
